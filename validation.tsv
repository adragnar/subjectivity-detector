eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 	1
it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring . 	1
everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 	1
it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future . 	1
whether you like rap music or loathe it , you can't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie . 	1

few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands . 	1
